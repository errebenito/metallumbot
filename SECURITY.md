# Reporting Security Issues
Your efforts to responsibly disclose security issues are appreciated and will be acknowledged. To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/errebenito/metallumbot/security/advisories/new) tab. 

You will receive a response indicating the next steps in handling your report, ideally within 30 days. After the initial reply to your report you will be informed of the progress towards a fix as it happens, and may be asked for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
